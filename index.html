	<h3>Hello World!</h3>

	<p>I am a sentence in a paragraph tag.</p>

	<p><strong>I am a sentence in a paragraph tag and a strong tag.</strong></p>

	<p><em>I am a sentence in a paragraph tag and an em tag.</em></p>

	<p><em>I am</em> a sentence with some <strong>text in a strong tag</strong> and some <em>text in an em tag</em></p> <!-- Multiple tags in another tag?! Cool! -->

	<div>I am a sentence in a div tag. A div tag is what is called a block element in HTML. By default a block element will fill the entire width of the page and cause elements after it to be pushed further down the page.</div>

	<br />

	<span>I am a sentence in a span tag. A span tag is what is called an inline element in HTML.</span>
	<span>By default an inline element only uses the space it needs and will not fill the entire width of the page or push other elements down the page.</span>
	<span>These are three span tags that all appear one after another. The span tag does not cause new lines to be displayed.</span>
